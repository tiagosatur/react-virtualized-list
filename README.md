# React Virtualized List
VirtualizedList component is a react virtual list built in react. Virtualization or windowing is a technique to help render big lists of data.
Currently, it is rendering 300k product data generated with faker-js. This shows us the power of this optimization technique.

It also buffers extra items at the top and at the bottom of the rendered items to help users get a better experience while scrolling, which means less flickering.
